Monte-Carlo Simulation of stock price simulation using brownian motion. The project is divided into two parts: the first part simulates particle motion which is the foundation of diffusion model using normal distribution, and the second part simulates the stock movements based on brownian motion. Both part of the simulation includes visual components using SFML.

The project is considered complete for now, but there are few bucket list I would like to add to the repo
1. Separate the code better into two classes for particle simulation and stock price simulation
2. Add IMGUI to add different parameters to each of the model.
3. Labelling x-axis and y-axis for the graph
